Model index reference

.. module:: django.db.models.indexes
   :synopsis: Built-in index types.

Index classes define a specific database index which can be created through
them. This document explains the API references of :class:`BaseIndex` which is
the base class for all other index classes. This includes the `index options`_
and `built-in indexes`_ Django offers. The indexes can be created in the
database via the :class:`~django.db.migrations.operations.AddIndex` class
as follows::

    from django.db import migrations, models

    class Migration(migrations.Migration):

        operations = [
            migrations.AddIndex(
                model_name='Book',
                models.Index('title', 'author', name='my_index_name')  # An index on the title and author fields
            ),
        ]

.. note::

    Technically, indexes are defined in `django.db.models.indexes`, but for
    convenience they're imported into :mod:`django.db.models`; the standard
    convention is to use ``from django.db import models`` and refer to the indexes
    as ``models.<IndexClass>``.

Index options
=============

``*fields``
-----------

.. attribute:: BaseIndex.fields

Index classes take the field names of which they are being used as arguments
directly during initialization.

``model``
---------

.. attribute:: BaseIndex.model

The model representing the table on which the index has to be set. This is an
optional argument.

``name``
--------

.. attribute:: BaseIndex.name

The name of the index, if any you want to keep in the database. If `name` is
not provided Django will create a name internally on it's own.

Built-in indexes
================

The various built-in index classes that Django provides are as follows:

``Index``
---------

.. class:: Index(*fields, **options)

    Creates the default index (B-Tree) in the database.

BaseIndex class
===============

The index classes (like ``Index``) are subclasses of the ``BaseIndex``
class. The structure of the BaseIndex class is as follows:

.. class:: BaseIndex(*fields, **options)

``fields`` will contain the names of the fields on which the index is desired.
``options`` allows ``model`` and ``name`` parameters.
